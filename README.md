# Public Repository for the MIDAS Network Ebola Interest Group

## About
This repository will be used by the Ebola Interest Group to share relevant information, files, and announcements that can be publicly shared and used. The Ebola Interest Group organizes a monthly video call where infectious disease modelers will update the group on their Ebola-related research and where public health agencies and other stakeholders can raise important questions to explore. Coordinated communication between scientists and public health stakeholders will enable a more efficient modeling process and more effective implementation of research findings into public health practice. 

## Public and private repositories
In addition to this public repository, we also created a private Github repository for Ebola-related modeling research that can be used by members to share information internally within the group only. To get access to the private repository, please contact one of the coordinators or email questions@midasnetwork.us. 

## Slack channel
The Ebola interest group has also created a [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ebolamcg/shared_invite/enQtNzIwMDM1OTIwMDgxLTg4ZDEwMDA0MDAxODE2NTdmZmQxMmM5MDMyNmY3YzI2NDUwNDhhM2M1YWYyMjU3MDY3ZDE1ZjkzZGFmMzg5NDg) that is open for any interested scientists or practitioner:
